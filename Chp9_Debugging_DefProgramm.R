#* ===============================
#* 
#* debugging: 
    # fix unanticipated problems
    # find the root cause of errors
    # traceback(), brower(), etc.

#* condition handling: 
    # functions can communicate problems
    # and how to take action based on these communications
    # communication problems to the users is the job of conditioning:
      # errors, warnings, messages

          # fatal errors: raised by stop() 
                        # and forces all execution to terminate
                        # used when there's no way for a function to continue
      
          # warnings: raised by warning()
                      # display potential problems
                      # e.g. some inputs are invalid
      
          # Messages: generated by messages()
                      # let the users know what you have done for a default arg

  # conditions are usually displayed in bold font or red

  # function authors can communicate with their users with print()
  # print output is NOT a condition

  # condition handling tools: 
      # tryCatch()
      # try()

  # 



#* denfensive programming: 
    # avoid common problems before they occur
