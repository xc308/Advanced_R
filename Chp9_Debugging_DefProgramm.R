#* ===============================
#* 
#* debugging: 
    # fix unanticipated problems
    # find the root cause of errors
    # traceback(), brower(), etc.

#* condition handling: 
    # functions can communicate problems
    # and how to take action based on these communications
    # communication problems to the users is the job of conditioning:
      # errors, warnings, messages

          # fatal errors: raised by stop() 
                        # and forces all execution to terminate
                        # used when there's no way for a function to continue
      
          # warnings: raised by warning()
                      # display potential problems
                      # e.g. some inputs are invalid
      
          # Messages: generated by messages()
                      # let the users know what you have done for a default arg

  # conditions are usually displayed in bold font or red

  # function authors can communicate with their users with print()
  # print output is NOT a condition

  # condition handling tools: 
      # tryCatch()
      # try()
    # take specific actions when condition occurs
   

#* denfensive programming: 
    # avoid common problems before they occur
    # principle: raise an error as soon as sth goes wrong
    # this takes 3 particular form:
        # checking inputs are correct
        # avoid non-standard evaluation
        # avoid functions that can return different types of output


#=========================
# 9.1 Debugging techniques
#=========================

# productively debug a problem with print()
# useful tools 
# outline a general procedure for debugging

# 4 steps:
  # realise you have a code
    # automated test for high quality of the paper

  # make it repeatable
    # once have a bug, be able to reproduce it on command
    # binary search, repeatedly remove half of the code
      # until you find the bug
    # if it takes a long time to generate the bug, 
      # also worthwhile to figure out how to generate it faster

  # figure where it is
  # figure it and test it
      # have automated test in place



# browser():
  # the function most similar to Rstudio debug
  # will start an interactive console in the env where error occured
  # Use options(error = browser) to turn it on,
      # re-run the previous command
  # then use options(error = NULL) to return to the default error behavior
  

# add browser() where you want execution to pause
# breakpoints behave similarly to browser()
  # but easier to set
# 

# same to adding browser() in the code, 
  # two other functions will add to code

# debug(): inserts a browser statement in the 1st line of the specified function
# undebug() removes it
# or use debugonce() to browse only on the next run


utils::setBreakpoint()
  # instead of taking function name, 
   # it takes a file name, line number, and finds an appropriate function for you


# These two functions are special case of trace()
  # which inserts arbitrary code at any position in an existing function
# To remove tracing from a function, use untrace()



#=======================
# 9.3 Condition handling
#=======================

# communication problems to users
# three tools:
  # try(): gives users ability to continue execution 
            # even when an error occurs
          
  # tryCatch(): lets you specify handler functions that cntrol 
            # what happens when a condition is signalled



#-----------------------------
# 9.3.1 Ignore errors with try
#-----------------------------

# try()
  # allows execution to continue even after an error has occure

f1 <- function(x) {
  log(x)
  10
}

f1("x")
# Error in log(x) : non-numeric argument to mathematical function

# but if wrap the statement that creates the error in try()
  # the error message will be printed but execution will continue

f2 <- function(x) {
  try(log(x))
  10
}
f2("a")
# Error in log(x) : non-numeric argument to mathematical function
# [1] 10

# can suppress the message with try(..., silent = TRUE)

# to pass larger blocks of code to try, wrap them in {}

try({
  a <- 1
  b <- "x"
  a + b
})


# capture the error of try function
  # if successful, the last result evaluted in the block
  # if unsuccessful, an invisble obj of class "try-error"

success <- try(1 + 2)
failure <- try("a" + "b")
class(success)
# [1] "numeric"

class(failure)
# [1] "try-error"



## try()
# particularly useful when applying a function to multiple elements in a list
elements <- list(1:10, c(-1, 10), c(T, F), letters)
results <- lapply(elements, log)

results <- lapply(elements, function(x) try(log(x)))


# no built-in function to test for the try-error class
  # so define one

# Then you can easily find locations of errors with sapply()
# and extract the successes or look at the inputs that lead to failure

is.error <- function(x) inherits(x, "try-error")
success <- !sapply(results, is.error)

results[success]
str(results[success])

# List of 3
#$ : num [1:10] 0 0.693 1.099 1.386 1.609 ...
#$ : num [1:2] NaN 2.3
#$ : num [1:2] 0 -Inf


# look at the inputs that failed
str(elements[!success])
# List of 1
# $ : chr [1:26] "a" "b" "c" "d" ...


# another useful trick try()
  # using a default value if an expression fails

# Simply assign the default value outside the try block
default <- NULL 
try(default <- read.csv("possibly-bad-input.csv", silent = TRUE))



#----------------------------------------
# 9.3.2 Handle conditions with tryCatch()
#----------------------------------------

# errors: made by stop()
# warnings: made by warning()
# messages: made by message()
# interrupts: by ESC OR ctrol +C

# tryCatch() map conditions to handlers
  # which are named functions called with the condition as an input

# when a condition is signaled,
  # tryCatch() will call the first handler whose name matches one of the classes
    # of conditions

# built in names: 
  # error, warning, message, interrupt, catch-all condition

# a handler function can do anything  
  # but will return a value or create a more informative error message


# below function sets up handlers that return the type of condition signalled

show_condition <- function(code) {
  tryCatch(code, 
           error = function(c) "error",
           warning = function(c) "warning",
           message = function(c) "message")
}

show_condition(stop("!"))
# [1] "error"
show_condition(warning("?!"))
# [1] "warning"
show_condition(message("??"))
# [1] "message"

# if no condition is captured, it returns the value of input
show_condition(10)
# [1] 10


## Catching interrupts can be useful if want to 
  # take special action when the user tries to abort running code
